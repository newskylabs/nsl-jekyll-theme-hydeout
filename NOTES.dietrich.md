The files / directories

  LICENSE.md, README.md, _includes/, _layouts/, _sass/, assets/

are copies from the Hydeout theme gem directory

  /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0/gems/jekyll-theme-hydeout-3.7.1

As local copies overwrite the versions from the gem directory,
only the edited / overwritten files have to be given while 
the unchanged files can be erased from the local directory.
(See the notes on the "Themes" page https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/)

I copied them into this directory to make it easier to experiment 
with them.
